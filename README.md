### Google HashCode 2018

## Scrum master: Ricardo Costa

Here we will try to solve the challenges from Google HashCode 2018. We are on IST solving this shit, you are welcome to send us [GOOD] code during the challenge (after we don't care, ok?).

Our team has one good python programmer, one that knows somethings and two noobs that only draw stuff. We will try to do something during this hours to justify the redbull and the powerbanks that we got.

See you soon!
